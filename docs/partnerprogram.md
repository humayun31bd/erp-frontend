## 1. Executive Summary & Market Opportunity

### 1.1 The Saudi Agency Dilemma (2026)
Across Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam, software development and IT agencies face an identical challenge:
* **Every single SME client demands ZATCA Phase 2 compliance** to avoid crippling statutory penalties.
* Building a custom cryptographic engine (canonicalization, SHA-256, ECDSA signing, UBL 2.1 XML, mTLS handshakes, and PIH chaining) costs **SAR 60,000 to SAR 120,000+** in senior engineering overhead per agency.
* Clients are slow to pay emailed invoices, demanding WhatsApp delivery and Mada/Apple Pay integration.

### 1.2 The Partner Program Solution: Powered by Numou Technologies Limited
The **Numou ERP Agency White-Label Program** transforms compliance from a costly custom-development burden into a **high-margin, recurring SaaS revenue stream (MRR)**:
* **100% Brandable:** Deploy a multi-tenant client portal under your own domain (e.g., `billing.youragency.sa`) with your logo, brand colors, and custom WhatsApp sender ID.
* **Plug-and-Play Infrastructure:** Numou Technologies Limited manages the AWS Riyadh hosting (me-central-1), HSM/KMS cryptographic signing, ZATCA clearance API tunnels, and Meta WhatsApp Cloud API webhooks.
* **Instant Provisioning:** Spin up a fully compliant tenant environment for any new client in **under 2 minutes**.
* **Massive Profitability:** Buy wholesale tenant capacity and API packs from Numou ERP; charge your clients standard retail subscription + setup fees and pocket the difference every month.

## 2. Partner Economics & Unit Margins (The MRR Engine)

### 2.1 The Reseller Profit Formula
Saudi service businesses routinely pay **SAR 250 to SAR 500 per month** for compliant invoicing and WhatsApp automation. As our partner, your cost per client drops to **SAR 40 - SAR 60/month**, yielding **75% to 84% gross profit margins**.

#### Financial Projection Matrix:
| Number of Active Clients | Typical Retail Price / Client | Total Monthly Revenue | Partner Platform Cost | Net Monthly Profit (MRR) | Net Annual Profit (ARR) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **15 Clients** | SAR 299 / mo | SAR 4,485 / mo | SAR 899 / mo (Starter) | **SAR 3,586 / mo** | **SAR 43,032 / yr** |
| **30 Clients** | SAR 349 / mo | SAR 10,470 / mo | SAR 1,699 / mo (Growth) | **SAR 8,771 / mo** | **SAR 105,252 / yr** |
| **50 Clients** | SAR 349 / mo | SAR 17,450 / mo | SAR 2,499 / mo (Enterprise) | **SAR 14,951 / mo** | **SAR 179,412 / yr** |
| **100 Clients** | SAR 399 / mo | SAR 39,900 / mo | SAR 2,499 / mo + bulk pack | **SAR 33,400 / mo** | **SAR 400,800 / yr** |

> [!TIP]
> **Additional Revenue Stream (One-Time Setup Fee):** Agencies typically charge clients an onboarding fee of **SAR 1,500 - SAR 3,500** for ZATCA Fatoora portal registration, OTP CSR generation, and template configuration. For 30 clients, that generates an immediate **SAR 45,000 - SAR 105,000 in upfront cash flow**.
